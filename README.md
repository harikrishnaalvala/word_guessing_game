# Hangman Game

This is a simple **Hangman** game implemented in Python. The player must guess a randomly chosen word by entering one letter at a time. The game provides a limited number of attempts before the player loses.

## Features
âœ… Randomly selects a word from a predefined list  
âœ… Allows the player to guess letters one by one  
âœ… Displays correct guesses and underscores for missing letters  
âœ… Keeps track of the number of remaining guesses  
âœ… Displays a **win** or **lose** message along with the correct word  
âœ… Asks if the player wants to **retry** after the game ends  

## How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Start guessing letters to reveal the hidden word.
4. You have **12 attempts** to guess the word correctly.
5. If you guess all letters before running out of attempts, you **win**! ðŸŽ‰
6. If you use all attempts without guessing the word, you **lose**. ðŸ˜¢
7. After the game ends, you can choose to **play again** or exit.
